# 6-Motor-Servo 

# Descreption 
This project demonstrates how to control six servo motors using an Arduino Uno and a breadboard for power distribution. 
The task involves two phases: 
first, the six servos perform a sweeping motion for 2 seconds, where each servo arm moves back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees in smooth increments. 
After completing the sweeping motion, all servo motors are programmed to hold a fixed position at 90 degrees, keeping their arms centered. 
The circuit is set up by connecting the signal pins of the servos to six PWM-capable digital pins on the Arduino (pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11). The breadboard is used to distribute a common 5V and GND supply to all the servos. This setup and program are ideal for learning servo motor control and can serve as the foundation for more complex robotics or automation tasks.
